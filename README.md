# gimp-ktx

Import [KTX](https://www.khronos.org/registry/KTX/specs/1.0/ktxspec_v1.html) and [KTX2](https://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/) files seamlessly into gimp

WARNING: Export will be implemented as soon as I find enough time.

## Building

Currently a useful build system is missing.
If vulkan (for `VkFormat`) and libktx are installed globally then `install.sh` can be used for compilation.

A PR with a build system would be very welcome.

## TODO

- [ ] Export
- [ ] CubeMap
- [ ] Multiple layers/channel/...
